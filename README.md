## Comp126 Final Project
This was my final project for Comp126. We had to use HTML/CSS and bootstrap in order to make our project.

I wanted to make a website that would be useful to me or my family and since they run a nail shop, so I thought "lets make my website themed like a nail website". I looked other nail salon websites to get an idea of what they would look like and this is what I came up with.

Overall this project definitely helped me learn HTML/CSS and a bit of bootstrap. The teacher was amazing, I love her and the passion she brings into teaching. This class would definitely help me make another website in the future and I am grateful that I took this class.
